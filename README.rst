coverage_merger
###############

Attempt to merge several coverage files in Cobertura XML format.

This project is not made to be perfect, neither general purpose,
this project is especially made to put the data to Sonar so that
complex build can be tested under several configurations and the
profiles merged together. Moreover, this project is made for
gcovr-generated files from gcov-collected profiles. It may not be
compatible with Java-generated Cobertura files.
